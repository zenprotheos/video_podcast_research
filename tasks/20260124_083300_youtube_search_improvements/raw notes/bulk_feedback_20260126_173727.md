* In step 0, give a tip to users that they can freely edit the search queries or add their own  list here to be processed. But we need to assess the user and visual flow. Currently, if user pastes in a list of search queries (5) and press ctrl+enter, the queries to run > number field > button \[clear planned queries] show. This obviously doesn't make any logical sense for UIUX. 
* Step 0 `queries to run` section seems to not be at an ideal location in the user flow. Under query planning settings, users already choose a max query. Once the search terms are listed in the text field, whatever that's there is what we actually run. The "Clear planned queries" button creates confusion for the user and it's easy enough to just select all and manually delete so let's remove it. 
* `Step 2: Configure AI Research (Optional)` should basically include the original prompt (or summarized by AI) plus the optional guidance (constraints, exclusions, etc) from step 0. Step 2 basically allows the user to edit the filter prompt or just proceed. The idea here is to autofill the text box for better UIUX.
* Custom models in "filter ai search" doesn't work but presets do. I'm wondering if there's a syntax issue somewhere. Here's a real working model that failed `openai/gpt-5-nano`
* thinking more on Step 2, I'm wondering if it's actually needed since the research prompt was already provided. The auto filter option should just be automated with a checkbox or binary button after step 3, since that's when the filter would happen - after raw results are generated and after deduplication. Perhaps in step 0, there should be a field for "required terms in title and description" which could add keyword match modifiers in the search query AND also inform the AI filter prompt?
* AI filter > I need to know exactly how this process flow looks like. Does the AI perform a separate LLM request/call for EACH keyword or is it somehow done in bulk? I'm concerned about efficiency, optimization, quality, reliability, cost, and a balance of all of these criteria. We need a UML doc in the task workspace folder with explanations. 
* We need to Update model LLM model presets currently in the filters to prioritize `openai/gpt-5-nano` as default. 4.5 haiku can be second option.
* After successfully getting the five planned queries on step one, the search execution mode default selection is single query instead of planned query. This needs to be dynamic, so if the user decides to use step zero to plan search queries and then generates the queries, then on step one, planned queries should be automatically selected. Now when planned query is selected, I still see irrelevant options here, like search query, enter YouTube search terms, and search YouTube. It's confusing when planned query is selected to still have the input field of search query, right? I feel like for single query, yes, we can keep that, but for planned query, that should hide and only show the button run planned queries.
* After user clicks on "filter videos with ai" and can copy/send shortlist, can the user update the filter prompt again and redo? What's the logic there? Does it filter the already filtered list or uses the original unfiltered list again? Obviously we want to treat it like a REDO/RETRY. 
* At the very end of the tool step, users can click one of the "Copy" buttons or "Send" button. When the `copy` button is pressed, there's a green tip note plus a list of all of the raw data and the user has to click AGAIN to actually copy that data. That's unnecessary. Clicking on the Copy buttons should just copy everything to the clipboard and the tip note should just give visual feedback and assurance that the action was successful or not (should be programmed properly if not already).
